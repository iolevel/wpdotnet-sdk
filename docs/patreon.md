The WpDotNet project is free and open source, and you can always build it from its sources (check out [how to get started](getting-started.md)). However, you can unlock a ton of additional value by becoming [a patron on Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/pchpcompiler). We have two tiers that give you a number of benefits on top of what the open source community gets:

=== "Poweruser"

    * Dedicated, private Discord channel
    * Blogs & Video Tutorials
    * Issue resolution
    * Nightly builds
    * Release builds
    * Access to private NuGet feeds
    * Shout-outs at the end of blogs & videos

=== "Superfan"

    * Everything in the Poweruser tier, plus:
    * Priority issue resolution
    * Private continuous testing
    * Listed as sponsor on our homepage
    * On demand video lessons & tutorials
    * Dedicated, private Discord channel only for Superfans
